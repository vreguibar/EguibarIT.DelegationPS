Set corresponding permissions to AD for the Delegation Model / Tier Model (PowerShell based)

This code is used to create and modify SACL and DACL for the Delegation Model / Tier Model / RBAC model

The AD Delegation Model (also known as Role Based Access Control, or simply RBAC) is the implementation of: Least Privileged Access, Segregation of Duties and “0 (zero) Admin“. By identifying the tasks that execute against Active Directory, we can categorize and organize in a set of functional groups, or roles. Those roles can be dynamically assigned to the Semi-Privileged accounts. This reduces the exposed rights by having what needs, and does provides an easy but effective auditing of rights. The model does helps reduce the running costs by increasing efficiency. Additionally increases the overall security of the directory, adhering to industry best practices.

The goal is to determine the effective performance of computer management. Designing a directory that supports an efficient and simple organic functionality of the company. Anyone can “transfer” the organigram of the company to AD, but often, will not provide any extra management benefit. Even worse, it may complicate it. Not to talk about security or segregation of duties and assets. Eguibar Information Technology S.L. can design the Active Directory based on the actual needs of the company focusing on computer management model. This benefits of the processes necessary for the daily management,  being more efficient, reducing maintenance costs and providing a high degree of security.
